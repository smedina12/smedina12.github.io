                <h4>Welcome to the future of education. Your education.</h4>  

<p>A few years ago, <b>Georgia Gwinnett College</b> was home to just over 100 students. 
Let’s just say – things have changed. 
What was once 260 acres of rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus, 
approaching 11,000 students. What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts to how you do things –
 your learning style, your work schedule and your life. From the ground up, GGC was designed 
to help you succeed.</p>
<h3>Founded</h3>

<p>In 1994, <i>Gwinnett County</i> was the largest county east of the Mississippi 
without a four-year college. So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and d
esignated it specifically for the development of a college campus. 
GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more than 
100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. 
Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the <b><i>University System of Georgia.</i></b></p></font>
